        <p style="text-align: justfy;">
            Social media marketing is the use of social media platforms and websites to promote a product or service.<br>
             Although the terms e-marketing and digital marketing are still dominant in academia, social media marketing is becoming more popular for both practitioners and researchers.
             <br>Most social media platforms have built-in data analytics tools, enabling companies to track the progress, success, and engagement of ad campaigns. 
             <br>Companies address a range of stakeholders through social media marketing, including current and potential customers, current and potential employees, journalists, bloggers, and the general public. On a strategic level, social media marketing includes the management of a marketing campaign, governance, setting the scope (e.g. more active or passive use) and the establishment of a firm's desired social media "culture" and "tone."
